# KEMA
KEMA (Kerbal Electron Modding Application) is another mod manager for Kerbal Space Program, using both CurseForge and CKAN databases.

I'm trying to achieve benefits from both launchers, such as the stability, portability and functionality of CKAN, and the visual simplicity of CurseForge.

Feel free to contribute!
